Motivation for the Creation of  Stock Predictor.

Intended Goals: Utilize multiple algorithms to determine the best causality relationship between IVs and DV (stock price) 
Algorithms of Interest : Multiple Linear Regression, Neural Network, Gradient Analuysis, Random Forest

Reasons: I lost a fair sum of money on stocks, and although attempting to create an algorithm to predict prices is farfetched and quant-esque, its a surefire way to understand causality and truly 
force myself to understand the nature of the stock market.
